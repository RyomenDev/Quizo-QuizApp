User Registration (registerUser): Registers users with email & password.
Login with Email (loginUserWithEmail): Allows users to log in using email & password.
Google OAuth Login (loginUser): Logs in users via Google OAuth (as per your existing implementation).
Password Reset (resetPassword): Allows users to reset their password.

Added password field (Required & hidden by default)
Hashed password before saving using bcryptjs
Ensured strong validation for security

optimized JWT authentication middleware for your application. This will handle:

âœ… JWT verification for protected routes
âœ… Proper error handling
âœ… Modular structure

How It Works
Checks if the Authorization header exists and follows "Bearer <token>" format
Extracts the JWT token from the header
Verifies the token using jwt.verify()
Attaches the decoded user data to req.user for further use
Handles errors gracefully with appropriate status codes

ðŸ”¹ Key Improvements
âœ… Email validation before checking the database
âœ… Standardized lowercase email storage
âœ… Default userType set to "student" if not provided
âœ… Returned useful user details (excluding password)
âœ… Better error handling & debugging logs


âœ… Fixed JWT_SECRET reference in loginUserWithEmail (was using process.env.JWT_SECRET instead of conf.JWT_SECRET)
âœ… Normalized email to lowercase in loginUserWithEmail and resetPassword
âœ… Better error messages for invalid email or password
âœ… Removed unnecessary console.log() for production-ready code
âœ… Ensured password is not returned when fetching user details
